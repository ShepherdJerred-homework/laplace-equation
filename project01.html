    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      For this project we will we will be writing a program to solve Laplace's
      equation.
    </p>
    <center>
      \(\nabla^2 t =
      \frac{\partial^2 t}{\partial x^2} +
      \frac{\partial^2 t}{\partial y^2}
      = 0\)
    </center>
    <p>
      This equation can be used to describe heat transfer.  For example,
      suppose you have a piece of sheet metal with heat applied to certain
      points around the edge.  The heat will gradually spread through the
      sheet metal until it reaches a point where Laplace's equation is
      satisfied.  The image below shows an example of a surface satisfying
      Laplace's equation where heat has been applied to the left and right
      edge.
    </p>
    <center>
      <img src="img/laplace.png"/>
      <small>Source: https://nibot-lab.livejournal.com/48933.html</small>
    </center>
    <p>
      As you can see in the image, the sheet has been divided into a grid of
      cells, and each cell has been assigned a temperature.  This
      discretization makes it possible to solve the Laplace equation using the
      Jacobi method.  This is an iterative method where you repeatedly replace
      the value of a cell with the average of its neighbors.
    </p>
    <center>
      \(m_{i, j} = (m_{i, j - 1} + m_{i - 1, j} + m_{i, j + 1} + m_{i + 1,
      j})/4\)
    </center>
    <p>
      However, when performing this method in your program, you should not
      actually make any changes to your matrix because they would affect
      future calculations.  Instead, you should create a new version of your
      matrix that contains the updated values.  This is reflected below by
      adding a superscript to describe each new version of the matrix.
    </p>
    <center>
      \(m^{k+1}_{i, j} = (m^k_{i, j - 1} + m^k_{i - 1, j} + m^k_{i, j + 1} + m^k_{i +
      1, j})/4\)
    </center>
    <p>
      You will repeat this calculation until you reach a <dfn>fixed
      point</dfn>&mdash;that is, a point where \(m^k\) = \(m^{k+1}\).
    </p>
    <h3>Implementation</h3>
    <p>
      We will represent our sheet metal as an \(M \times N\) array, where
      \(M\) and \(N\) are selected by the user.  We will assume there is a
      layer of &ldquo;air&rdquo; around the sheet metal which does not change.
      Thus, you should actually represent your sheet metal as an \((M + 2)
      \times (N + 2)\) array so that there is an extra row and column at the
      beginning and the end.  (This has an added advantage of eliminating edge
      cases: every cell in the sheet has all four neighbors.)
    </p>
    <p>
      To avoid confusion, we will always express cells in this sheet as
      row-column pairs, <em>not</em> X-Y coordinates.  Thus, the cell \((3,
      7)\) refers to row \(3\), column \(7\).  Note that row \(0\) is the top
      air layer, row \(M + 1\) is the bottom air layer, column \(0\) is the
      left air layer, and column \(N + 1\) is the right air layer.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will define our heat sources as rectangular regions in our sheet.  We
      will express rectangular regions as two cells: the upper left corner
      and the lower right corner.  For example, the region \(\{(10, 10), (20,
      50)\}\) would be all cells with row \(r\) and column \(c\) such that \(10
      \le r \le 20\) and \(10 \le c \le 50\).
    </p>
    <p>
      To simplify things, we will assume that all heat sources are lines
      contained in the air around the sheet.  If our sheet is an \(M \times
      N\) grid, then our heat sources will always be rectangles \(\{(r_1,
      c_1), (r_2, c_2)\}\) such that at least one of the following is true:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>\(r_1 = r_2 = 0\)</li>
      <li>\(r_1 = r_2 = M + 1\)</li>
      <li>\(c_1 = c_2 = 0\)</li>
      <li>\(c_1 = c_2 = N + 1\)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By placing our heat sources in the air region (which does not change) we
      ensure that the heat sources remain constant.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will represent temperature as a number between 0 and 1, with 1 being
      the highest and 0 being the lowest.
    </p>
    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The main process should input the following:
        <ul>
          <li>The number \(M\) of rows in the sheet</li>
          <li>The number \(N\) of columns in the sheet</li>
          <li>The number \(h\) of heat sources</li>
          <li>For each heat source:
            <ul>
              <li>The row, then column of the upper-left corner</li>
              <li>The row, then column of the lower-right corner</li>
              <li>The temperature as a number between 0 and 1, inclusive</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the Jacobi method to solve Laplace's equation.  To do this,
        repeatedly update each cell with the average of its neighbors as
        described above.  You should do this until an update results in
        no <em>significant</em> changes.  We will consider
        a <em>significant</em> change any change \(\ge 0.001\).  Thus, you
        should stop at the first \(m^k\) such that \(\forall_{i, j} |
        m^{k}_{i, j} - m^{k-1}_{i, j} | \lt 0.001\).
      </li>
      <li>
        Output the entire sheet, including the air layer.  Output one row per
        line, separating columns with spaces.  You may have a trailing space
        at the end of your lines.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Parallelization</h3>
    <p>
      You <em>must</em> parallelize your solution using MPI.  Here is the
      recommended approach:
    </p>
    <ul class="spaced">
      <li>
        Divide the sheet into even regions by dividing up the rows.  You may
        assume that \(M\) is divisible by the number of processes.  Each
        process will actually need to store \(M + 2\) rows: its \(M\) rows
        plus the row above and the row beneath.
        <p>
          For example, suppose \(M = 8\) and we have \(4\) processes.  That
          means we actually have \(M + 2 = 10\) rows counting the air layers.
          Each process needs \(M / 4 = 2\) rows as follows:
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <div class="proc">Process 0</div>
              <div class="ro">0</div>
              <div class="rw">1</div>
              <div class="rw">2</div>
              <div class="ro">3</div>
            </td>
            <td>
              <div class="proc">Process 1</div>
              <div class="ro">2</div>
              <div class="rw">3</div>
              <div class="rw">4</div>
              <div class="ro">5</div>
            </td>
            <td>
              <div class="proc">Process 2</div>
              <div class="ro">4</div>
              <div class="rw">5</div>
              <div class="rw">6</div>
              <div class="ro">7</div>
            </td>
            <td>
              <div class="proc">Process 3</div>
              <div class="ro">6</div>
              <div class="rw">7</div>
              <div class="rw">8</div>
              <div class="ro">9</div>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          The rows in parentheses will not be edited by that process; they
          will only be used to update the rows that process is responsible
          for.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        After each update, the processes will need to communicate the
        updated rows to their neighbors.  For example, process 0 will need
        to send the updated row 2 to process 1, and process 1 will need to
        send the updated row 3 to process 0.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each process will need to notice if its rows have had significant
        changes.  Then your processes will need to communicate to decide
        whether <em>any</em> process has had significant changes.  (Hint:
        consider <code>MPI_Allreduce</code>.)  If <em>any</em> process had
        significant changes, then <em>all</em> processes need to continue for
        another round.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>
      You are welcome to use <a href="matrix.hpp">my matrix class</a> if you
      wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a significantly larger MPI program than we have written so far.
      There are a couple of implications of that fact.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You need to have checkpoints.  Do <em>not</em> attempt to write the
        whole thing and then begin debugging.  There will be way too many
        places for bugs to hide.  Instead, try to get one small piece working,
        then verify that it works.  For example:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Have the main process input and distribute the input.  Have each
            process print out the input to make sure it was received
            correctly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Have each process print its initial chunk of the sheet to make
            sure it is correct.
          </li>
          <li>
            Have each process make one iteration of the algorithm and print
            its chunk to make sure it is correct.
          </li>
          <li>
            Have processes exchange rows and print their chunks to make sure
            it is correct.
          </li>
          <li>etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When printing chunks, I recommend using barriers to make sure output
          comes out synchronized and not in a jumbled mess.  Here is the
          output function I used:
        </p>
        <pre class="brush:cpp">
void print_all_chunks(int tag) {
	for (int i = 0; i &lt; num_procs; ++i) {
		if (my_rank == i) {
			cout &lt;&lt; '[' &lt;&lt; tag &lt;&lt; "] Process " &lt;&lt; my_rank &lt;&lt; " has chunk:\n" &lt;&lt; my_chunk &lt;&lt; endl;
		}
		MPI_Barrier(MPI_COMM_WORLD);
	}
}
</pre>
        <p>
          It is recommended that you use debugging macros to make it easy to
          include/exclude debugging output, like so:
        </p>
        <pre class="brush:cpp">
#ifdef IS_DEBUG
		if (tag % 1000 == 0)
			print_all_chunks(tag);
		++tag;
#endif
</pre>
        Then if you want to see the debug output you can simply add the
        following to the top of your program:
        <pre class="brush:cpp">
#define IS_DEBUG
</pre>
        Begin by testing your program with small test cases.  Here is a good
        one for 1, 2, or 4 processes:
        <pre class="example">4 4
1
0 0 0 5 1</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        You need to organize your program to keep it manageable.  Your
        subroutines should be no more than one screenful and should be easy to
        read and digest.  Here's the organization I used for my program.
      </li>
      <pre class="brush:cpp">
struct laplace {
